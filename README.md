If I want to watch and listen to something else during Peloton rides, what can I use instead of the instructor to know the cadence/resistance/zone?

This command should copy the files over to the correct iCloud directory. If there's an error about a missing `data/rides.js` file, browse to that directory the Files app on the iPhone or iPad and try again.

    cp -R ~/Documents/Projects/2021\ spinscript/* ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud\~dk\~simonbs\~Scriptable/Documents/
